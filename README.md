# Advent Of Code 2022 - Solutions
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of programming puzzles released in December each year that can be solved in any programming language. Correctly solving all of the puzzles earns 50 stars.

This year I am aiming to write solutions in R and python.

## Updates
2022-12-12 - Currently running a little behind, who would of thought December would be a busy month! Will try to catch up this week. Typically going to focus on R solutions, but may switch to python later on for the more challenging puzzles.

## R
I'm utilising my new favourite framework, the [***box***](https://github.com/klmr/box) package, to structure my R code. Modules for solving each puzzle reside within the `R` directory and the `main.r` script is ran to generate the answers for each day.

Box provides a mechanism for "writing reusable, composable and modular R code", is much simpler to use than the R package system, and encourages a more pythonesque approach to imports, bringing in as little as required in terms of dependencies.

## Python
Python solutions are written as self contained scripts and can be found in the `python` directory.

## Current Stars Earned
Total :star:'s = ***24***
